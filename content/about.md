## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here?

This blog serves as a growing archive of things I explore, debug, and build—mostly revolving around **tech**, **Linux**, **coding**, and the tools that make all of it just a bit more efficient.

Most of what I write is rooted in hands-on learning—small guides, notes, and how-tos. 

- 🧪 Anything I learn the hard way—and want to remember

If it runs in a terminal or helps solve real problems, it’s fair game here.

##  Why This Blog Exists?

I’ve always found that writing clarifies thinking. This space helps me document what I learn and share it in a way that’s helpful to anyone walking a similar path—especially those who enjoy working with systems, code, and clean command lines.

You won’t find fluff here—just honest breakdowns of what works (and sometimes what doesn’t).
