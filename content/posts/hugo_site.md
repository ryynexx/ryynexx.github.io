The reason why Hugo is so popular and why you should work with it lies in its key features:

- **Lightning-Fast**: Hugo builds your entire website in mere seconds, ensuring your site works smoothly no matter the size.

- **Easy Content Management**: Makes content organization a breeze, giving you full control over your site’s structure.

## How to Get Started with Your Site on Hugo

Starting with Hugo is straightforward and quick. Follow these steps:

### 1- Install Hugo

- **On Linux**

```bash
sudo snap install hugo
```

- **On macOS**

```bash
brew install hugo
```
- **On Windows**

Download the Windows binary from [Hugo's official releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

### 2- Create a New Site
Creating your site is a breeze:

```bash
hugo new site my-website
cd my-website
```
This will generate your new Hugo site.

### 3- Apply a Theme
Look for a theme you like on [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) then clone it with:

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/hugo-PaperMod
```
Then update your `config.toml` file:

```toml
theme = "theme-name"
```

### 4- Create Content

Create your first post using:

```bash
hugo new posts/first-post.md
```
Edit the Markdown file in `content/posts` and add your content.

### 5- Preview on Local Server
Run the Hugo server to check out your site:

```bash
hugo server --noHTTPCache
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313` to see your site in action.

### 6- Build Static Files for Deployment

Run:

```bash
hugo
```
This will create a `public/` folder containing your static HTML files.

## Deploy Your Site on GitHub Pages

### 1- Create a Repository for Your Site

1. Go to GitHub.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Set the name of the repository to `yourusername.github.io`.

### 2- Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a workflow directory and `.yaml` configuration file in your Hugo site directory.

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cd .github/workflows
touch hugo.yaml
```

### 3- Add Configurations
Edit `hugo.yaml`:

```yaml

git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO.git
git push -u origin master
```
> **Note**: Copy the git remote file from your GitHub repository.

### 5- Configure the Repository Pages Settings

1. Go to 'Settings' of your repository.
2. Enter the 'Pages' section.
3. Change the 'source' to **GitHub Actions**.

### 6- Check Deployment Status

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Actions** from the main menu.
2. Look for the workflow named **Deploy Hugo site to Pages**.
